# Homework Assignment 7

#### Group: James, Christian, Michael



1. Exercise When you imported the IMDB tables in the last homework, we used varchar values for every destination table. We did this because we wanted to ensure that the COPY command doesn't run into data integrity errors. These tables with varchar data types don't lend themselves well for future analysis. We will create a view for each table where we ensure that the data types are more conducive to analysis.



Step 1: Run the script below to make sure that all fields are varchar values in your first table (title_basic)

```
    select table_name, column_name, data_type 
    from IMDB.information_schema.columns
    where  table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'title_basic';
```

Step 2: With the help of the online [IMDB documentation](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) create views for every table where you cast every column to the matching target data type. Below you can see the title_basic view as an example.

```
-- title_basics table
select table_name, column_name, data_type 
from IMDB.information_schema.columns
where  table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'title_basics';

create view imdb.public.etl_title_basic_v
as
select 
 tb.tconst
,tb.titletype
,tb.primarytitle
,tb.originaltitle
,cast(tb.isadult as boolean) as isadult
,cast(tb.startyear as integer) as startyear
,cast(tb.endyear as integer) as endyear
,cast(tb.runtimeminutes as integer) as runtimeminutes
,regexp_split_to_array(tb.genres,',')::varchar[] as genres       
from imdb.public.title_basics tb;
```

```
-- name_basics table
select table_name, column_name, data_type 
from IMDB.information_schema.columns
where  table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'name_basics';

create view imdb.public.etl_name_basics_v
as 
select 
  nb.nconst,
  nb.primaryname,
  cast(birthyear as integer) as birthyear,
  cast(deathyear as integer) as deathyear,
  regexp_split_to_array(nb.primaryprofession ,',')::varchar[] as primaryprofession, 
  -- Make the datatype based on the array type that is listed on the site (array of tconst which is a string)
  regexp_split_to_array(nb.knownfortitles ,',')::varchar[] as knownfortitles 
from imdb.public.name_basics nb 
```

```
-- title_akas
select table_name, column_name, data_type 
from IMDB.information_schema.columns
where  table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'title_akas';


create view imdb.public.etl_title_akas_v
as 
select *
from imdb.public.title_akas ta 
```

```
-- title_crew
select table_name, column_name, data_type 
from IMDB.information_schema.columns
where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'title_crew';

create view imdb.public.etl_title_crew_v
as 
select 
  tc.tconst,
  regexp_split_to_array(tc.directors,',')::varchar[] as directors,
  regexp_split_to_array(tc.writers,',')::varchar[] as writers
from imdb.public.title_crew tc 
```

```
-- title_episode
select table_name, column_name, data_type 
from IMDB.information_schema.columns
where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'title_episode';

create view imdb.public.etl_title_episode_v
as 
select 
  te.tconst,
  te.parenttconst,
  cast(te.seasonnumber as integer) as seasonnumber,
  cast(te.episodenumber as integer) as episodenumber 
from imdb.public.title_episode te 
```

```
-- title_principals
select table_name, column_name, data_type 
from IMDB.information_schema.columns
where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'title_principals';

create view imdb.public.etl_title_principals_v
as 
select 
  tp.tconst,
  cast(tp."ordering" as integer) as "ordering",
  tp.nconst,
  tp.category,
  tp.job,
  tp."characters" 
from imdb.public.title_principals tp 
```

```
-- title_ratings
select table_name, column_name, data_type 
from IMDB.information_schema.columns
where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'title_ratings';

create view imdb.public.etl_title_ratings_v
as 
select 
  tr.tconst,
  cast(tr.averagerating as decimal) as averagerating,
  cast(tr.numvotes as integer) as numvotes 
from imdb.public.title_ratings tr 
```

Step 3: Create a physical table using the views from step 2. Use the `xf_` prefix to differentiate these new tables (with the correct data types) from the raw imported tables.

```
create table imdb.public.xf_name_basic
as
select * from imdb.public.etl_name_basics_v;
```

```
create table imdb.public.xf_title_akas
as
select * from imdb.public.etl_title_akas_v;
```

```
create table imdb.public.xf_title_basic
as
select * from imdb.public.etl_title_basic_v;
```

```
create table imdb.public.xf_title_crew
as
select * from imdb.public.etl_title_crew_v;
```

```
create table imdb.public.xf_title_episode
as
select * from imdb.public.etl_title_episode_v;
```

```
create table imdb.public.xf_title_principals
as
select * from imdb.public.etl_title_principals_v;
```

```
create table imdb.public.xf_title_ratings
as
select * from imdb.public.etl_title_ratings_v;
```

Step 4: Use the `ALTER TABLE` statements from the previous homework to establish the primary and foreign key relationships.

```
alter table imdb.public.xf_name_basic
add primary key (nconst);
```

```
alter table imdb.public.xf_title_basic
add primary key (tconst);
```

```
alter table imdb.public.xf_title_crew
add primary key (tconst);
```

```
alter table imdb.public.xf_title_episode
add primary key (tconst);
```

```
alter table imdb.public.xf_title_ratings
add primary key (tconst)
```

**NOTE:** We attempted to add the primary key relation to other tables that used tconst as a foreign key as well (title_crew, title_episode, title_principals, title_ratings). However, when attempting to add the foreign key relation, some values in the primary key table are missing which prevented us from establishing the primary key to foreign key relation. 

```
alter table imdb.public.xf_title_ratings
add constraint FK_tconst_ratings
foreign key(tconst) references imdb.public.xf_title_basic(tconst)
```



2. Exercise

   1. How many movies are in the `xf_title_basic` table with runtimes between 42 and 77 minutes?

   ```
   select count(*)
   from imdb.public.xf_title_basic
   where runtimeminutes between 42 and 77
   ```

   ​	**Answer:** 508,654

   

   2. What is the average runtime of movies for adults?

   ```
   select avg(runtimeminutes)
   from imdb.public.xf_title_basic
   where isadult = true
   ```

   ​	**Answer:** 94.48

   

   3. Without running the SQL below, what number should it return? In other words, what is the cartesian product of the xf_title_basic table with itself?

      ```
      select count(*) from (
      select xtb_a.runtimeminutes, xtb_b.runtimeminutes
      from imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb_a, imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb_b
      )x;
      ```

      **Answer:** xf_title_basic * xf_title_basic

      **Answer part #2:** Because we have to count all the rows in the above query, the cartesian product of title_basics with itself would be billions of rows.

      

   4. Calculate the average runtime (rounded to 0 decimals) of movies where the genre's first element is 'Action'. (Hint: the first element of an array in Postgres can be referenced like this: array_name[1]) How many of all moves in the `xf_title_basic` has the previously calculated average runtime?

      ```
      select round(avg(runtimeminutes))
      from imdb.public.xf_title_basic
      where genres[1] = 'Action'
      ```

      **Answer:** 48

      ```
      select count(*) as total_action_movies
      from imdb.public.xf_title_basic
      where round(runtimeminutes) = 
      	(select round(avg(runtimeminutes))
      		from imdb.public.xf_title_basic
      		where isadult = true)
      ```

      **Answer:** 7,985

      

   5. What is the relative frequency of each distinct genre array (combination of genres)?

      ```
      select "genres", count(*) as genre_combinations
      from imdb.public.xf_title_basic
      group by "genres"
      ```

      **Answer:** 

      | genres                     | genre_combinations |
      | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
      | {Action}                   | 31487              |
      | {Action,Adult}             | 80                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Adventure}   | 56                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Animation}   | 51                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Comedy}      | 37                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Crime}       | 78                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Documentary} | 1                  |
      | {Action,Adult,Drama}       | 28                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Fantasy}     | 11                 |
      | {Action,Adult,History}     | 1                  |
      | {Action,Adult,Horror}      | 10                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Mystery}     | 1                  |
      | {Action,Adult,Romance}     | 7                  |
      | {Action,Adult,Sci-Fi}      | 16                 |
      | {Action,Adult,Short}       | 4                  |
      | {Action,Adult,Sport}       | 1                  |
      | {Action,Adult,Thriller}    | 4                  |
      | {Action,Adult,War}         | 4                  |

3. In this exercise, you will check the cardinality of the relationship between two tables: `title_basic` and `title_crew`.

   Step 1: To establish cardinality, we first need to join the two tables together. Use a `FULL OUTER JOIN` and join the two tables together with the help of the tconst column.

   ```
   select * 
   from imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb
   full outer join imdb.public.xf_title_crew xtc
   on xtb.tconst = xtc.tconst 
   ```

   Step 2: Take the count of the `title_crew.tconst` column grouped by the title_basic.tconst column.

   ```
   select xtb.tconst, count(xtc.tconst)
   from imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb 
   full outer join imdb.public.xf_title_crew xtc
   on xtb.tconst = xtc.tconst 
   group by xtb.tconst 
   ```

   Step 3: Take the min() and max() of the previously calculated count.

   ```
   with count_CTE as (
   	select xtb.tconst, count(xtc.tconst) as countTconst
   	from imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb 
   	full outer join imdb.public.xf_title_crew xtc
   	on xtb.tconst = xtc.tconst 
   	group by xtb.tconst 
   ) select min(countTconst) as min_tconst, max(counttconst) as max_tconst from count_CTE
   ```

   **Answer:**

   | min_tconst | max_tconst |
   | ---------- | ---------- |
   | 0          | 7244       |

   

   Based on these, what is the cardinality of the relationship between these two tables?

   **Answer:** Based on the output, the relationship between the two tables is 0-to-many. 

4. Repeat exercise 3 for every relationship that `title_basic` has.

Note down how many different cardinalities are there between `title_basic` and the rest of the tables.

```
-- title_basics to title_episode 
with count_CTE as (
	select xtb.tconst, count(xte.tconst) as countTconst
	from imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb 
	full outer join imdb.public.xf_title_episode xte
	on xtb.tconst = xte.tconst 
	group by xtb.tconst 
) select min(countTconst) as min_tconst, max(counttconst) as max_tconst from count_CTE
```

**Answer:**

| min_tconst | max_tconst |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 0          | 3020       |

```
-- title_basics to title_principal
with count_CTE as (
	select xtb.tconst, count(xtp.tconst) as countTconst
	from imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb 
	full outer join imdb.public.xf_title_principals xtp 
	on xtb.tconst = xtp.tconst 
	group by xtb.tconst 
) select min(countTconst) as min_tconst, max(counttconst) as max_tconst from count_CTE

```

| min_tconst | max_tconst |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 0          | 14649      |

```
with count_CTE as (
	select xtb.tconst, count(xtr.tconst) as countTconst
	from imdb.public.xf_title_basic xtb 
	full outer join imdb.public.xf_title_ratings xtr 
	on xtb.tconst = xtr.tconst 
	group by xtb.tconst 
) select min(countTconst) as min_tconst, max(counttconst) as max_tconst from count_CTE

```

| min_tconst | max_tconst |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 0          | 1          |



Note down how many different cardinalities are there between `title_basic` and the rest of the tables.

**Answer:** The relationships that there were between title_basic and the rest of the tables, they were all a 0 to many relationship.
