**Question 1:** Are movie ratings normally distributed? To answer this question, take the following steps.

- Visualize the data in a histogram and observe if the ratings adhere to a bell curve (use PowerBI to do this)
- Look at the descriptive statistics of the data (n, min, max, mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
- Calculate the relative frequency distribution of movies ratings ([here](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/odessa-introstats1-1/chapter/frequency-frequency-tables/#:~:text=To find the relative frequencies,fractions, percents, or decimals.&text=Cumulative relative frequency is the accumulation of the previous relative frequencies.) is a refresher on relative frequency )
- Carry out the Shapiro-Wilk Test described [here](http://www.real-statistics.com/tests-normality-and-symmetry/statistical-tests-normality-symmetry/shapiro-wilk-test/)
