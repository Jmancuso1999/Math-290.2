# Homework Assignment 12

### Group: James Mancuso, Christian G, Michael V.



As always, if you experience an error message, write it up and record your work in the [MATH_290_Knowledge_Base](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cTduVN-MqKQnQ6DTwRQYigieR1N7aov7YIvcbDXLXQ0/edit?usp=sharing).

We will continue exploring the previously downloaded [IMDB database](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).

By the end of this tutorial, you will build a general function that can return the min, max, sum, and count of an input column.

We are going to be using the aggregate function we covered during the last class.

To work with aggregates, we need to define our accumulation and result from data types. These are going to be user-defined data types as well. Since we want to receive basic descriptive statistics (count, min, max, and mean), we should create the following two types:

```
create type _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type AS (
n bigint,
min double-precision,
max double-precision,
m1 double precision
);
```

The user-defined type above will hold the variables from the intermediate state function, while the one below will hold your results.

```
  create type _desc_stats_simple_agg_result_type AS (
    count bigint,
    min double precision,
    max double precision,
    mean double precision
    );
```

Next, we will create the state transition function responsible for doing the more significant part of the work.

```
create or replace function _desc_stats_simple_agg_accumulator(_desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type, double precision)
returns _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type AS '
DECLARE
	a ALIAS FOR $1;
	x ALIAS FOR $2;
	n1 bigint;
	delta double precision;
	delta_n double precision;
	
BEGIN
	IF x IS NOT NULL then
		n1 = a.n;
		a.n = a.n + 1;
		delta = x - a.m1;
		delta_n = delta / a.n;
		a.m1 = a.m1 + delta_n;
		a.min = least(a.min, x);
		a.max = greatest(a.max, x);
	end if;
	
	RETURN a;
END;
'
language plpgsql;
```

This state transition function will do the following for every numeric value of x passed in (as long as it is not null):

1. Take the value of n stored in _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type (a.n) custom type and assign it to the n1 state transition function variable.
2. Increment the value of a.n with one
3. Subtract the value of m1 stored in _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type (a.m1) and subtract it from x (the current row value). and store the resulting value in delta.
4. Divide the previously calculated delta by a.n and assign the resulting value in delta_n.
5. Take the sum of delta_n and a.m1 and assign it to a.m1.
6. Take the lesser of a.min or x and assign it to the a.min value
7. Take the greatest of a.max or x and assign it to the a.max value.
8. Return a which is _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type.

Next, we will be creating a finalizer function for our descriptive statistics function.

```
create or replace function _desc_stats_simple_finalizer(_desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type)
returns _desc_stats_simple_agg_result_type AS '
BEGIN
	RETURN row(
		$1.n, 
		$1.min,
		$1.max,
		$1.m1
	);
END;
'
language plpgsql;
```

The above finalizer will create a row value representation of the variables defined in the _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type.

Finally, we will create the aggregate that creates a mapping between the state transition function and its type, assigns the initial condition, and identifies the finalizer function.

```
create or replace aggregate desc_stats_agg(double precision) (
sfunc = _desc_stats_simple_agg_accumulator,
stype = _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type,
finalfunc = _desc_stats_simple_agg_finalizer,
initcond = '(0,,,0)'
```

);

Now you can call the _desc_stats_agg function on all numeric columns.

**Exercise 1:** Expand the function you built from the tutorial above to work with Kurtosis and Skew as well.

```
drop type _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type

create type _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type AS (
	n bigint,
	min double precision,
	max double precision,
	m1 double precision,
	m2 double precision,
	m3 double precision,
	m4 double precision
);

drop type _desc_stats_simple_agg_result_type

create type _desc_stats_simple_agg_result_type AS (
	count bigint,
	min double precision,
	max double precision,
	mean double precision,
	variance double precision, 
	skewness double precision,
	kurtosis double precision 
);
```

```
drop function _desc_stats_simple_agg_accumulator

create or replace function _desc_stats_simple_agg_accumulator(_desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type, double precision)
returns _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type AS '
DECLARE
	a ALIAS FOR $1; -- This is for _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type type, we are just calling it a
	x ALIAS FOR $2; -- x represents the double precision value that we pass in
	n1 bigint;
	delta double precision;
	delta_n double precision;
	delta_2 double precision;
	num double precision;
	
BEGIN
	IF x IS NOT NULL then
		n1 = a.n;
		a.n = a.n + 1;
		delta = x - a.m1;
		delta_n = delta / a.n;
		a.m1 = a.m1 + delta_n;

		
		a.m4 = a.m4 + term1 * delta_2 * (a.n*a.n - 3*a.n + 3) + 6 * delta_2 * a.m2 - 4 * delta_n * a.m3;
		a.m3 = a.m3 + term1 * delta_n * (a.n - 2) - 3 * delta_n * a.m2;
		a.m2 = a.m2 + term1;
		a.min = least(a.min, x);
		a.max = greatest(a.max, x);

	end if;
	
	RETURN a;
END;
'
language plpgsql;
```

```
drop function _desc_stats_simple_finalizer

create or replace function _desc_stats_simple_finalizer(_desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type)
returns _desc_stats_simple_agg_result_type AS '

	RETURN row(
		$1.n, 
		$1.min,
		$1.max,
	    $1.a,
	    $1.b / nullif(($1.n - 1.0), 0), 
	    case when $1.b = 0 then null else sqrt($1.n) * $1.c / nullif(($1.b ^ 1.5), 0) end, 
	    case when $1.b = 0 then null else $1.n * $1.c / nullif(($1.b * $1.b) - 3.0, 0) end
	);
END;
'
language plpgsql;

```

```
drop aggregate desc_stats_agg(double precision);

create or replace aggregate desc_stats_agg(double precision) (
	sfunc = _desc_stats_simple_agg_accumulator,
	stype = _desc_stats_simple_agg_accum_type,
	finalfunc = _desc_stats_simple_finalizer,
	initcond = '(0,,, 0, 0, 0, 0)'
);
